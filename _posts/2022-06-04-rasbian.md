# Installing Rasbian OS

Instructions for setting up Rasbian on a Raspberry Pi.

## Install From Scratch
Clean up the SD Card - Remove all partitions and format as FAT32 then download and install and run the latest Pi Imager. In the imager press CTRL+SHIFT+X to bring up special settings and set the following:
* hostname
* ssh
* pi user password
* timezone
* keyboard
* WiFi SSID and passcode

Select the preferred OS and write to the SD - insert the SD into the Pi and boot.
Note: This can also be used to write to an NVME card.

## Install From an Image
Use Win32DiskImager to load a previously saved image

## Post Installation
Plug in SD/SSD card and boot then update the software
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
To remove plain text WiFi password run the wpa_passphrase to get an encrypted entry to put in the wpa_supplicant file.
```bash
wpa_passphrase <SSID> <PSK>
```
For example `wpa_passphrse wifssid passphrase` will give somthing like:
```
network={
        ssid="wifissid"
        #psk="passphrase"
        psk=452f4f6194d1dbc368f7cef6ec09ffd74a4073b62bc6ba4afea97035c4e70d85
}
```
## If using ArgonOne
Install the power button and fan control
```bash
sudo curl https://download.argon40.com/argon1.sh | bash # To set power button and fan control
argonone-config # To change fan settings
```

## Opional bit if the pi will be a Kubernetes node
      Optionally for a Kubernetes node - edit cmdline.txt add
        cgroup_enable=memory ip=192.168.1.xx::192.168.1.1:255.255.255.0:kube-1:eth0:off
