```

## Mathematics

The mathematics powered by [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/):

$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6} $$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

## Inline code

This is an example of `Inline Code`.

## Filepath

Here is the `/path/to/the/file.extend`{: .filepath}.

## Code block
