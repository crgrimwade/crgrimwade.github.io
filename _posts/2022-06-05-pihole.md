Pi-Hole provides a combinations of ad-blocking and protection from malicious sites. It does this by intercepting all name lookups and comparing them to a defined list of sites and if the lookup matches one on its blacklist it blocks the lookup. For any "local" lookups (i.e. without a full domain name e.g. `myhost` or with a local domain name e.g. `myhost.localdomain`) it will forward the request to a local DNS server - usually the router. For any non local FQDNs e.g. `google.co.uk` it will forward to the outside world - in this installation that uses `unbound` which goes direct to the root DNS servers rather than to your internet provider or google, this helps prevent those organisations controlling what you can see and using your lookups for their marketting goals.

# Preparation Step 1 - Freeing up port 53
DNS lookups use specified default ports - in some linux e.g. `ubuntu` installations these ports have dummy dns configurations so we need to make sure these are clear before setting up Pi-Hole. In my setup on the NAS this step is not required. First check if the port is in use, then if it is reconfigure the `resolv.conf` file in `/etc`
```
lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN     # Check if port 53 is already in use.
cd /etc
rm resol.conf
ln -s ../run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
sed -r -i.orig 's/#?DNSStubListener=yes/DNSStubListener=no/g' /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service
```
# Preparation Step 2 - Increasing the available memory
Temporary fix - lost after reboot
```
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=1048576
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=1048576
```
To make it permanent
```
echo "net.core.rmem_max=1048576" >/etc/sysctl.d/local.conf
echo "net.core.wmem_max=1048576" >>/etc/sysctl.d/local.conf
```
# Installing Pi-Hole and Unbound in Docker
Use the docker compose file at the bottom of the post to create a docker stack with two containers `pihole` and `unbound` make sure to adjust the volumes to map to your intallation and configure the docker network, timezone and passwords etc. When complete start the stack - this will create various configurations within the mounted volumes.

## Configuring Unbound
Unbound needs to know how to forward requests from Pi-Hole out to the internet, avoiding those DNS servers that track your activity - such as google. The following actions should be done in the `/opt/unbound/etc/unbound` folder of the unbound docker container or in the host folder to which it is mapped e.g. `/volume1/Docker/unbound`

First Fetch the `root.hints` file - this file will contain IPv6 details which can optionally be commented out - do this for any line with an AAAA type record.
```
wget -O root.hints https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root
```
Next create an `a-records.conf` file with the following contents:
```
# A Record
#local-data: "somecomputer.local. A 192.168.1.1"

# PTR Record
#local-data-ptr: "192.168.1.1 somecomputer.local."
```
Then finally edit the `unbound.conf` file - see [pihole documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/) for more details
and an example of this file can be found at the end of this post.

## Configuring Pi-Hole
We need to tell Pi-Hole to forward requests within our local IP ranges to our local DNS server (typically our router). Access the Pihole GUI (hostname:82/admin) and in the DNS tab of settings configure the following:
* enable  - Never forward non-FQDNs
* enable  - Never forward reverse lookups for private IP ranges
* disable - Use DNSSEC
* enable  - Use Conditional Forwarding
* Local networks - set to your network e.g. `192.168.1.0/24
* Ip address of your DHCP server - typically the address of your router
* Localdomain - set this to whatever your router/DHCP server uses to qualify local names e.g. localdomain

When all the configurationis complete test the Pi-Hole DNS resolution - see below for how to test DNS. If/When all the testing is succesful configure your router to tell its clients to use Pi-Hole for their primary DNS resolution and the router as a secondary DNS server.

### Adding Blocklists
Then populate the blocklists for sites that should be avoided - see [FireBog](https://firebog.net/) for potential lists. Goto `Addlists` in the `Group Management` menu to add lists. Copy the URL from FireBig to PiHole to add a list.

Always update gravity after changing the blocklists - this can be found under the `Tools` menu.

Firebog has lots of different list categories covering malicious sites to simply those that use trackers. In general add any malicious sites then choose what else to add. Note adding advertisment list can speed up page loads for ad heavy web pages and blocks some annoying youtube overlay ads (but not the full clips ones).

# Testing PiHole and Unbound

## Unbound
Use `dig` to send requests to the unbound container on port 5053 - this tests that unbound is correctly forwarding DNS requests to the root servers.  Check the docker logs to look for any issues
```
dig www.google.com @unbound-host -p 5053 # Replace unbound-host with the relevant unbound IP address
```

## PiHole
Use `dig` to test PiHoles DNS resolution
```
dig www.google.com @pi-host -p 53 # Replace pi-host with the relevant unbound IP address
```
Then with `nslookup` test various scenarios
```
nslookup google.co.uk          # Test with default server
nslookup google.co.uk router   # Test with router as server
nslookup google.co.uk pi-host  # Test using Pi-Hole as servers
# Test local lookups: Compare results, check that Pi-Hole sends requests to router
nslookup plexserver            # Test with default server
nslookup plexserver router     # Test with router as server
nslookup plexserver pi-host    # Test using Pi-Hole as servers
```

# Known Issues

```
        Known Issue: { DNS resolution is currently unavailable when starting pihole
          Make sure the host system of Pi-Hole is NOT using Pi-Hole for DNS
          Happens if the docker host is using pihole as its only name resolution (check /etc/resolv.conf)
          - recommendation that everyone add --dns 127.0.0.1 --dns 1.1.1.1 to their docker run commands in order to avoid these types of errors
          not managed to get the above to work yet
          - Just add "nameserver 192.168.1.1" to start of /etc/resolv.conf (change IP to that of the router) 
          restart pihole container - Might be able to remove this afterwards, but likely need to re-add to restart pihole
          might be possible to add as second item and leave in - needs further investigation
          - apt install resolvconf
          systemctl start resolvconf.service
          systemctl enable resolvconf.service
          vi /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head # add nameserver 8.8.8.8         
```
