# What is Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms your plain text into beautiful static web sites and blogs. It can be use for a documentation site, a blog, an event site, or really any web site you like. It’s fast, secure, easy, and open source. It’s also the same site generator I use to maintain my open source documentation. Today, we’ll be installing and configuring Jekyll using the Chirpy theme. We configure the site, create some pages with markdown, automatically build it with a GitHub action and even host it for FREE on GitHub pages. If you don’t want to host in the cloud, show how to host it on your own server or even in Docker.

Thanks goes to [Techno Tim](https://docs.technotim.live/posts/jekyll-docs-site/) on which this is based

## Install Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ruby-full ruby-bundler build-essential zlib1g-dev git
```
To avoid installing RubyGems packages as the root user:
```bash
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems'      >>~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"'       >>~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >>~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
Install Jekyll bundler
```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```
## Initialising GIT

Create directory ~/.ssh
Get copies of id_rsa and id_rsa.pub and put in ~/.ssh and set permissions to 600
```bash
    git config --global user.email "your.email@gmail.com"
    git config --global user.name "github username"
```

## Creating a site based on Chirpy Starter
Visit [https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#quick-start](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#quick-start) scroll down and select "Chirpy Starter" in step one.

When the create repo page is displayed set the repo name to username.github.io and set to public if yu intend to host this in GIT.

After creating a site based on the template, clone your repo and setup the bundle dependencies
```bash
git clone git@<YOUR-USER-NAME>/<YOUR-REPO-NAME>.git
cd reponame
bundle
```
Edit the _config.yml file and configure the following:
```
timezone: Europe/London               # Set your timezone
title:  My Title                      # the main title
tagline: My Installation Notes        # Set tagline - it will display as the sub-title
description: >-                       # used by seo meta and the atom feed
  A minimal, responsive, and powerful Jekyll theme for presenting professional writing.
url: 'https://githubuser.github.io'   # Set url to the github reponame
github:
  username: githubuser                # change to your github username
```

# Create Some Posts

To see how to create markdown visit [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

When done publish back to GIT by
```
git status
git add .
git status
git commit -m "made some changes"
git push
```
## Local Test Server
Run a temporary server to view the content default url is http://localhost:4000
```bash
bundle exec jekyll s --host host-ip --port portnum
```
## GitHub Server
In the repository in github select settings - then pages (on the left) and change the source from "main" to "gh-pages" the URL for the github hosted pages will be https://githubuser.github.io/

## Local Hosting
First build the site pages using the command below - this creates the "website" in the ~/reponame/_sites folder which can then be copied into webserver such as ngnix.
```bash
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll b
```
## Create a file in `_posts` with the format

```file
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
```

For example:

```file
2022-05-23-homelab-docs.md
2022-05-34-hardware-specs.md
```
