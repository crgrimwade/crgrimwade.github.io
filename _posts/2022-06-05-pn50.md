This post describes how to install a dual boot Windows and Ubuntu onto a PN50, this starts with the installation of Windows followed by the addition of Ubuntu. The PN50 in question has a 250G primary SSD and a 250G NVME drive.

# Installing Windows
Download a copy of the windows installer and burn to a memory stick, insert into the PN50 and boot to the memory stick and follow the installation instructions to install this onto the NVME. Then boot into windows and shrink the windows partition to around 50G to make room for the Ubuntu installation.

# Installing Ubuntu
Download ubuntu desktop iso image and use Rufus to load it onto a memory stick selecting GPT & UEFI mode.

Boot to the memory stick and select install from the list of options. When the partition menu comes up select custom and create a new partition for ubuntu, select the partition marked as EFI as the location for the boot loader and complete the installation.

Test that both Windows and Ubuntu can be accessed when booting.
